## v3.0.0 (Date: 2020-05-07)

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Upgraded from Bootstrap 3.3.2 to 4.4.1. This involved a major rewrite of most components. This shouldn't affect any users unless you have custom HTML/CSS code which the new Bootstrap could have broken.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Renamed `bigimg` YAML parameter to `cover-img`.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed `googlefonts` YAML parameter since googlefonts are just CSS so they can be loaded via `ext-css`. 
- **BREAKING CHANGE** Upgraded from jQuery 1.11.2 to 3.4.2. This should not affect most people.
- Added `navbar-border-col` setting in the config file.
- Add accessibility features where possible.
- Made the theme completely responsive by rewriting all CSS to use 'rem' instead of 'px'.
- Rewrite and simplify some JavaScript code to use CSS or Bootstrap alternatives that weren't available in 2015.
- Remove most of the sample posts so that users only have two sample posts to learn from.
- Improvements to the README instructions.
