**During that period,There was a marked jump of** 8% **from** 25% **to** 33% **in** market shares of Chinese brands, **while that of** Japanese brands **declined significantly**, **by** 10% **from** 35% **to** 25%.
**At the same time, the percentage of** American brands **remained steady.**


**There are at least two fundamental causes accounting for these changes.**
**On the one hand,** advancements in science and technology have offered a technical foundation for the rapid development of the Chinese automobile industry by providing a material basis and technical means.
**MeanWhile, it's not difficult to notice that these days national** automobile companies **in mounting numbers have turned to** price promotions to boost scales.
