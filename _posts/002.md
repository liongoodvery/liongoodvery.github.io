Dear Sir or Madam,

    I am a student in this university who regularly comes to the library to
spend my spare time. Generally speaking, the services you offer here are quite
good; However I have some suggestions for you to consider.And I would greatly
appreciate your taking my suggestions into consideration.

    To begin with, will you please prolong the time allowed for reading? In the
daytime, most of the students are having class, so they can't come to the 
library. Moreover, some of the books on the shelves are out of date. If you
could be so kind as to provide us with some more recent publications such as the
latest magazines, we would be grateful.

    I really wish to have a more comfortable library. Thank you for your time
and consideration.
                                                                Yours sincerely,
                                                                Li Ming
