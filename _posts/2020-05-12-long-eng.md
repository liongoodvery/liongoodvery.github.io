<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
   <p> Moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved
so far, I would like to contribute my bit to the project by offering financial aid  to a child in
a remote area of your province.</p>
   <p> I would be very grateful if you could help me seek out a girl who has just started
schooling but whose family cannot offord her education. My plan is to pay for her tuition
on an annual basis until she finishes her secondary education. I would like to remit my
donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Li Ming</p>
