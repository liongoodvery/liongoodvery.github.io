Dear Bob,

I am writing the letter to express my apologies to you.

To begin with, I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt appreciation
for the kind assistance you rendered me during my stay in Canada. During my stay in
Canada, I borrowed a CD of Beethoven's symphonies from you. Unfortunately, when I 
returned home, I found to my surprise that the CD was in my personal baggage due to
my carelessness.

To solve the problem, I would like to send this CD to you by Express Mail Service. 
Once again, please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences that I have
caused. I hope this will settle the matter to your satisfaction.

                                                                Yours sincerely,
                                                                Li Ming
