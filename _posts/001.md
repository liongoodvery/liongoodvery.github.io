Dear Sir or Madam,  
    Moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what
has been achieved so far, I would like to contribute my bit to the project
by offering financial aid to a child in a remote area of your province.
    I would be very grateful if you could help me seek out a girl 
who has just started schooling but whose family cannot afford her eduction.
My plan is to pay for her tuition on an annual basis util she finishes her secondary
education. I would like to remit my donation directly to a bank account
opened by her family in her local area.
                                                        Yours truly
                                                        Li Ming
