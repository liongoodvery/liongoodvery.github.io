<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
   <p>I am a student in this university who regularly comes to the library to spend my spare time. Generally speaking,the services you offer here are quite good; however, I have some suggestions for you to consider. And I would greatly appreciate your taking my suggestions into consideration.</p>
   <p>To begin with, will you please prolong the time allowed for reading? In the daytime ,most of the students are having class, so they can't come to the library. Moreover,some of the books on the shelves are out of date. If you could be so kind as to provide us with some more recent publications such as the latest magazines,we would be grateful.</p>
   <p>I really wish to have a more comfortable library. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Bob,</p>
<p>I'm writing the letter to express my sincere apologies to you.</p>
<p>To begin with, I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt appreciation for the kind assistance you rendered me during my stay in Canada. During my stay in Canada, I borrowed a CD of Beethoven's symphonies from you. Unfortunately, When I returned home, I found to my surprise that the CD was in py personal baggage due to my carelessness.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, I would like to sned this CD to you by Express Mail Service. Once again, please accept my sincere apologies for any inconviniences that I have caused. I hope this will settle the matter to your satisfaction</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Yours sincerely,</p>
