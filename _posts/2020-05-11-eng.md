Dear Sir or Madam,  

Moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved so far, I would like to contribute my bit to the project by offering financial aid to a child in a remote area of your province.

I would be very grateful if you could help me seek out a girl who has just started schooling but whose family cannot afford her eduction. My plan is to pay for her tuition on an annual basis util she finishes her secondary education. I would like to remit my donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area.

<p style="text-align:right">Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Li Ming</p>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
   <p>I am a student in this university who regularly comes to the library to spend my spare time. Generally speaking,the services you offer here are quite good; however, I have some suggestions for you to consider. And I would greatly appreciate your taking my suggestions into consideration.</p>
   <p>To begin with, will you please prolong the time allowed for reading? In the daytime ,most of the students are having class, so they can't come to the library. Moreover,some of the books on the shelves are out of date. If you could be so kind as to provide us with some more recent publications such as the latest magazines,we would be grateful.</p>
   <p>I really wish to have a more comfortable library. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Bob,</p>
<p>I'm writing the letter to express my sincere apologies to you.</p>
<p>To begin with, I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt appreciation for the kind assistance you rendered me during my stay in Canada. During my stay in Canada, I borrowed a CD of Beethoven's symphonies from you. Unfortunately, When I returned home, I found to my surprise that the CD was in my personal baggage due to my carelessness.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, I would like to send this CD to you by Express Mail Service. Once again, please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences that I have caused. I hope this will settle the matter to your satisfaction. </p>
<p style="text-align:right">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Editors,</p>

<p>I have been reading your newspaper for many years with great enthusiasm and interest. Regarding this issue of disposable plastic bags, it is my view that limiting the use of such bags is of the utmost significance.</p>

<p>To crack the hard nut, I would like to propose several practical recommendations as follows. First and foremost, it is imperative for us to ban the free use of disposable plastic bags. In addition, we should develop possible alternatives to replace them, such as paper or cloth bags. Last but not least, plastic bags should be offered at a much higher price in department stores or supermarkets.</p>

<p>I hope you will find the above proposals constructive and I would like to discuss this matter in further detail. Your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.</p>


<p style="text-align:right">Yours sincerely,</p>
